<SlideTemplate title="Performance Matters">

On the web, performance is **hugely important**.
We can use CSS animations and transitions to add just a dash of interface animation to our work, or go all out with WebGL to create a full 3D experience, all within our browser. Having this huge range of options is wonderful.

1. 🌿 Use **css** properties for animating simple things such as **opacity, scale, rotation,** and **position** (when done with transforms).  
2. 🌿 As your animations grow in **complexity** and the need for deeper logic, move to **JavaScript** solutions that can accomplish what you need.  
3. 🌿 Always keep an eye on **how much you are loading** in versus **what you’re actually using**.

<Hint>
  Animation alone can’t make your interface faster, but it can help create the perception that things are happening faster.
